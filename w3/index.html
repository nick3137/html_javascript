                <p>Hello, my name is Nicholas Ward-Smith and this is my autobiography. I'm twenty one years old, my favorite color is blue and I've been playing video games for as long as I can remember. My first video game I can recall playing was Mario on the N64 at my grandmothers house. Everytime we would go over I would be glued to the television and play. Since then I've played many games and only a select few were my favorites. Aside from video games I'm a avid D&D player and I've been playing for at least six years. It is a great stress relief and if you haven't tried it I highly suggest you should! <a href="https://dnd.wizards.com/">Link to Dnd website</a> I also play magic the gathering which is somewhat like D&D however in card form; this is a fun  hobby for those who enjoy some competition. Schooling and learning new content has always been a hard strugle for me growing up. It takes a couple tries before i can really get a grip on the content, which is why I tend to ask many questions or if I'm doing something correct. I've always had a strong interest in gaming and the creation behind and I alway thought it would be fun to give it a try and learn more about the process. It's always been a personal dream of mine to make my own game or even help with the plot of it. Hopefully if i stick to it and really give it my all I'll be able to put my ideas to work and really make something of it.</p>
