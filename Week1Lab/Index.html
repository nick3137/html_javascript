          <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">Hello, my name is Nicholas Ward-Smith and this is my autobiography. I'm twenty one years old, my favorite color is blue and I've been playing video games for as long as I can remember. My first video game I can recall playing was Mario on the N64 at my grandmothers house. Everytime we would go over I would be glued to the television and play. Since then I've played many games and only a select few were my favorites. Aside from video games I'm a avid D&D player and I've been playing for at least six years. It is a great stress relief and if you haven't tried it I highly suggest you should! I also play magic the gathering which is somewhat like D&D however in card form; this is a fun  hobby for those who enjoy some competition. </p>
